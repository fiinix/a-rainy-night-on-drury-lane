            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">I never intended to write</span>
                a novella, it just—sort of—happened. Back when I penned Part I,
                which would later be titled With Sensual Red Lips, I never meant
                for it to be more than a one-off, self-indulgent collection of
                literary cliches.</p>
            <p>But then my wife asked, “What happened next?”</p>
            <p>To which I, of course, had no reply because it had never crossed
                my mind that it would go anywhere at all.</p>
            <p>And now, rather than to tell you this beautiful tale about how
                she had stirred something deep inside me, I will instead tell
                you the real reason I continued with this story. The real reason
                that a short one-off grew from its humble origin of a 1 000
                words into the—still quite humble—10 000 word novella you now
                have before you.</p>
            <p>Sure, the real reason isn’t nearly as complex or nuanced as a
                blatant lie would be. In fact, I think you’ll find that my
                reason is quite mundane, but at least it’s mine.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I, simply, wanted to please her curiosity.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Now, to those of you who have already read this story, there
                isn’t <em>really</em> any reason for you to read it again, you
                know how the story goes; Boy takes one last job to make rent,
                boy dies at the end.</p>
            <p>But if you’ll indulge me one more time, I think I can make it
                worth your while. Because, although the main story has remained
                intact, a smaller—more personal—story emerged. One that I hadn’t
                anticipated. And rather than try to fight it, I gave in to it
                and made it a part of the original story.</p>
            <p>Finally by going through and editing, I could tidy up all those
                loose ends I had left behind and structure what had lacked a lot
                of focus in its infancy. And I think it’s better for it. I hope
                you’ll feel the same way.</p>

            <h2>That White Blinding Light</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">“Then the witches rushed through</span>
                the air with great cries,” Catherine threw her hands into the
                air, “and fled back to Slievenamon, uttering strange curses on
                the Spirit of the Well, who had wished their ruin. But the woman
                and the house were left in peace and a mantle dropped by one of
                the witches in her flight was kept hung up by the mistress in
                memory of that night; and this mantle was kept by the same
                family from generation to generation for five hundred years
                after.”</p>
            <p>“The end.”</p>

    </div>

<div class="viewport">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p class="first-paragraph">Kissing Henry and Mary on their foreheads
                Catherine tucked them in a little tighter than she normally
                would, “That was the last one. No more stories tonight.”</p>
            <p>“But mam please—” they both cried out in unison.</p>
            <p>“Not tonight. Now it’s bedtime for you two snappers,” blowing out
                the candle she left the door ajar to let some light in from the
                kitchen.</p>
            <p>Stepping outside and inhaling the crisp night air was just the
                kind of wake up she needed. The night was deceitfully calm. Two
                months ago President Thomas Woodrow Wilson had asked congress to
                declare war on the German Empire, for the good of the American
                people and “To make the world safe for democracy,” as he so
                idealistically had put it. The European War had already been
                raging on for almost three years now and Catherine had already
                lost enough in a war she didn’t believe in.</p>
            <p>She, like so many other Irish immigrants, thought that the
                British Empire deserved no help from America but with no
                position to voice her thoughts, she kept them to herself.</p>
            <p>Walking towards Patrick’s Ale House, Catherine tried to not let
                her nerves get the best of her. Summer was racing towards them
                this year and she already found it difficult to move around
                during the day because of the heat. But she also knew better
                than to complain though, as any ‘real’ New-Yorker would
                instantly remind her of a heatwave a few years back, “Whose like
                can never be contested.”</p>
            <p>So she tried to enjoy the cool night air but found herself too
                distracted by a million little thoughts, all which wanted her
                attention.</p>
            <p>Stepping into the tavern the smoke and smell of an evening’s
                worth of cigarettes took her by surprise and she found herself
                struggling to breath through the thick wall of smoke.</p>
            <p>The alcohol was flowing freely and Catherine could hear a
                delightful fiddling tune—that instantly reminded her of home—in
                the background. Even so, she didn’t want to spend a minute more
                than necessary in this place.</p>
            <p>“Excuse me, where can I find a man named Rory?” Catherine
                carefully asked the woman behind the bar disk.</p>
            <p>“That’ll be ‘im, right over ‘dere,” the woman replied as she
                pointed towards an unkempt man engrossed in a game of Darts he
                was only observing, with one hand stroking his beard and the
                other hand safely rested on a pint of ale.</p>
            <p>“Are you… Rory?”</p>
            <p>“I may or may not be, love. I take it your not a guard by the
                looks ‘o ‘ya,” the burly man in front of her never dropped his
                eyes of the game of Darts.</p>
            <p>“Whadda want? I’ve got no bloody time for culchies,” trying to
                get something out of his teeth Rory’s tongue was moving around
                methodically.</p>
            <p>“Maggie sent me. She said you would have some—” she took a deep
                breath, “—work for me.”</p>
            <p>“A culchie like you? Don’t make me laugh,” glancing at her he
                continued, “Besides, our kind ain’t too popular anyway and that
                scar of yours ain’t doin’ ‘ya no favours.” </p>
            <p>Catherine instinctively reached for her sore black eye, the
                sudden touch reminded her of that white blinding light she had
                seen as her landlord’s open palm had hit her face.</p>
            <p>“Ask me bollocks, you’ve got ‘til the end ‘o the week to pay
                rent,” her landlord had said without flinching.</p>
            <p>But she knew all too well that Rory had meant the scar along the
                left hand side of her face. The permanent reminder, unlike her
                black eye which would fade with time, of that unfortunate
                accident from Catherine’s childhood where she and her brothers
                had played carelessly in a field where some farmers had
                forgotten their tools and she had tripped and fallen face first
                on a hoe.</p>
            <p>Stunned but equally relieved at her rejection Catherine mustered
                her courage and asked, “Well, is there anything else I could do?
                I have two children and—”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, yeah,” Rory’s attention was back at the game of Darts,
                “With yer face I might ‘ave somethin’ you could do.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>“Anything.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>“That’s the spirit, love. ‘Ave ‘ya heard of the Gopher Gang?”
                Rory asked and drank the rest of his pint.</p>
            <p>“That’s… that gang on Hudson Street isn’t it?”</p>
            <p>“Close enough. It just so happens that I’ve got myself a bit of a
                problem with one ‘o the lads in what’s left of the Gophers. I
                was going to take care of him myself but somethin’ tells me this
                would be the perfect way to see if ‘ya’ve got the stomach for
                what comes next. I’ll also pay ‘ya $160 to remove this problem
                from my life,” without a drink in his hand, Rory was back to
                trying to dislodge whatever was stuck in his teeth.</p>
            <p>“Comes next?” she whispered to herself.</p>
            <p>“What’s it gonna be? Like I said, I’ve got no bloody time for
                culchies. You think you can stomach somethin’ other than chicken
                blood on those pretty little hands of—”</p>
            <p>“I can,” Catherine said with as much strength as she could
                gather.</p>
            <p>“Good. The man you’re looking for goes by the name of Sidney
                ‘Smallfists’ McCoy, a good for nothin’ thug who usually hangs
                around Seventh Avenue. Come back here and we’ll talk more when
                he’s not running his gob anymore,” Rory started rolling himself
                a cigarette.</p>
            <p>Catherine, seeing this as her opportunity, got up to leave. The
                thought of staying another second made her stomach turn and she
                needed to get out into the fresh night air again.</p>
            <p>“I never did catch your name, now did I?” taking his eyes of the
                game for the second time Rory watched Catherine walking
                away.</p>
            <p>She paused only long enough to answer him, “Just call me
                Grace.”</p>

            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">The rain is pouring down</span>
                on Drury Lane, covering the city of Chicago and filtering out
                the wailing sirens with its white noise. Detective Wentworth is
                sitting at his desk, listening to his favorite tune by Marion
                Harris, a half-smoked cigarette in one hand and a glass of
                scotch—the cheapest his bootlegger had—in the other.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="viewport">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p class="first-paragraph">He is only a dame with a revealing short
                dress away from being a symptom of his time and he knows it. He
                knows it too well. As he takes another sip of his scotch and
                fights the urge to vomit—he isn’t much of a drinker but feels
                obligated to be—the harsh clicking sounds of a woman’s high
                heels begin to echo through the hallway of his
                office-turned-apartment.</p>
            <p>After deciding to go into early retirement his rent has been
                overdue for the past three months and whilst he has done his
                best to avoid his landlord, he knows it’s only a matter of time
                before Mr. Clay’s greedy eyes finds him, sneaking in late at
                night to avoid a confrontation. He preferred to not think about
                what would happen to him, should Mr. Clay ever find out that he
                didn’t have any money. The subdued clicking sounds of heels
                against damp wooden floorboards grows closer.</p>
            <p>“Maybe I thould try to make a run for it? Thhe ith probably
                nothing but trouble,” he thought to himself.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth had long ago come to terms with his—sometimes
                incomprehensible—lisp. This was the way he had always spoken and
                no amount of ‘corrections’ from his father would ever change
                that, but what he found difficult to understand was, “Why did
                his thoughts also have a lisp?”</p>
            <p>He had made some—mostly failed—attempts at training his lisp away
                in his teens but with very little results to show for it, he had
                decided that they were doomed to fail, and since then, tried his
                best to forget all about them.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth could now hear how the dame—who he imagined
                was blonde with sensual red lips and breasts held tightly by the
                dress she wore so shamelessly—just outside his door. Not
                expecting visitors—he never had any—Detective Wentworth had felt
                no need to put on pants this morning. A decision he now
                regretted, as he realized she would knock on his door any
                second.</p>
            <p>Three faint knocks and then, nothing.</p>
            <p>“Juth a thecond, I’m a bit buthy,” having found his pants, he was
                about to get his fly closed when the threading in the last
                button came undone and the button rolled underneath his
                desk.</p>
            <p>The three knocks had decreased to two.</p>
            <p>“Please, may I come in? I need your help,” the desperation in her
                voice was unmistakeable.</p>
            <p>Sitting down at his desk again to conceal his otherwise visible
                underpants Detective Wentworth replied, “Yeth, of courthe. Come
                in.”</p>
            <p>Despite being at least 20 years older then Detective Wentworth,
                he couldn’t help but find himself thinking she was quite the
                looker. Expect for the gray streaks that had begun to cover her
                once golden blonde hair she was exactly as he had imagined. Her
                lips were painted red and the dress she wore, with no shame in
                sight, held her breasts in tightly.</p>
            <p>Gesturing her towards the only vacant chair in the room he
                continued, “Thit down. Would you like a glath of thcotthh?”</p>
            <p>“Thcotthh?” she said looking questioning at him.</p>
            <p>Lifting his glass and looking towards the bottle on his desk he
                tried again, “Can I get you a drink?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, no thank you. I don’t drink anymore,” folding the dress
                underneath her as she sat down, “Though at times like these I
                almost wish I still did. You see, my little Bobby didn’t come
                home for Thanksgiving.”</p>
            <p>Her breathy voice was distracting Detective Wentworth from
                listening with his fullest attention but he managed to pick up
                enough pieces to form a decent picture of what had happened.</p>
            <p>Anna McWilliams, mother of three successful children, one of who
                was senator Robert ‘Bobby’ McWilliams, would bring her family
                together every Thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>“You might be a big shot senator now but you’re still my little
                Bobby and I want you home for the holiday,” she would remind him
                of whenever he tried to make excuses for why he wouldn’t be able
                to make it.</p>
            <p>“Will you make the apple pie like I like it?” Bobby always
                asked.</p>
            <p>To which she would reply, “Have I ever made it any other
                way?”</p>
            <p>“Fine mom, I’ll see at 5pm.”</p>
            <p>Except the clock had struck five. And six. And seven. And finally
                on the stroke of eight, Anna had called senator Robert
                McWilliams’ assistant Helen who had insisted that, “Senator
                McWilliams had left his office at 4.15pm, heading towards the
                family home to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family,” and that
                she hadn’t heard from him since.</p>
            <p>At which point Anna McWilliams had picked up her phone for a
                second time, called her lawyer and asked for the number to a
                good private detective. Unfortunately all the good private
                detectives that Mrs. McWilliams’ lawyer knew were either too
                preoccupied or too dead, and he had instead given her the number
                to the first private detective he found through the yellow
                pages.</p>
            <p>A fact that neither Anna McWilliams or Detective Wentworth
                knew.</p>
            <p>“So, can you please find my Bobby?” reaching from her purse she
                handed him an envelope bulging from its content, “Here’s half
                and I’ll pay you the other half as soon as you can give me any
                more information about my Bobby.”</p>
            <p>“I’ll thee what I can do. But I won’t make any promitheth yet,”
                Detective Wentworth had learned the hard way to not make
                promises unless he was sure he could keep them.</p>
            <p>Reaching into her purse again Mrs. McWilliams handed Detective
                Wentworth an unrecognizable blob made from a thin strip of
                metal, “My Bobby can get a little suspicious sometimes but if
                you show him this, he’ll know that I sent you.”</p>
            <p>After studying the metal blob for a moment Detective Wentworth
                realized what he was holding: A gingerbread cookie cutter in the
                shape of an angel.</p>
            <p>“I’ll thee what I can find out. I’ll get back to you in a few
                days,” Detective Wentworth got up and showed Anna McWilliams to
                the door.</p>

            <h2>The Brown Note</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">A few rain soaked hours</span>
                later Detective Wentworth found himself at the Brown Note, a
                sleazy jazz joint for con artists, criminals and aspiring
                musicians, trying to get a drink from a barkeep imaginatively
                named Joey. After several failed attempts at ordering scotch
                from Joey, Detective Wentworth had settled for beer.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="viewport">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p class="first-paragraph">“Maybe I thhould thtart drinking beer
                inthtead? Eathier to thtomach and eathier to pronounthe,” he
                thought to himself as he was finding a vacant table to
                occupy.</p>
            <p>He was waiting for an informant to show up, a shady immigrant
                with many aliases who had recently taken to calling himself
                Nobody.</p>
            <p>“Who are you talking to?” someone would ask and then receive the
                cheesy but effective answer of, “Nobody. I’m talking to
                Nobody.”</p>
            <p>It worked 90 percent of the time. The remaining 10 percent was
                reserved for henchmen with baseball bats and a score to settle.
                Nobody didn’t have many options in life and had played the cards
                handed to him. A mouse in a country of cats, he simply made the
                best of the situation—even though that sometimes meant going
                head-to-head with the henchmen of whoever he had betrayed—to get
                whatever he needed.</p>
            <p>“Half loaf is better than no loaf,” Nobody would remind himself
                when times got even tougher, “Half loaf is better…”</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth’s eyes followed the young woman selling
                cigarettes from her tray—hoping she would spare him a glance—as
                he was drawing the last breath from the last cigarette from a
                packet he had bought as recently as last night. It was meant to
                be his last packet of cigarettes.</p>
            <p>Then again, the Sparrow Brothers case was supposed to be his last
                case and look how that turned out.</p>
            <p>“Thingth have a habit of not ending when they’re thuppothed to,”
                he muttered faintly as the cigarette saleswoman walked by. He
                gestured towards her and as he caught her attention, she also
                caught his.</p>
            <p>“Jothephine?” he gasped, but as he left the question mark
                lingering in the air he could tell by the look on her face that
                she was definitely not Josephine. What he had at first thought
                to be the spitting image of his Josephine, now only resembled
                her when looked at from the corner of an eye. It was the way she
                moved that had deceived him but now that he was looking directly
                at her, he could see clearly. Swaying back and forth like a
                drunk—she probably had an inner-ear problem just like
                Josephine—as she reached him he could see that she looked
                nothing like her. “Eight more beerth and I would have never
                known the differenthe,” he thought to himself.</p>
            <p>“What’ll it be, sugah?”</p>
            <p>Her accent was thick and she made no efforts to hide it.</p>
            <p>“Three packetth of Deep Throat and tell Joey I’ll have another
                beer.”</p>
            <p>“Sorr hon, I only gots me two packs of ‘dem Deep Throat left. But
                I’ll give ‘dem to ya for 23¢”</p>
            <p>“Here you go, and you can keep the thhange if you can get that
                beer here on the double.”</p>
            <p>He wasn’t convincing anyone that he was cool but there was no
                point in stopping his attempts now, “Might ath well go the whole
                hog,” he thought to himself and realized that he hadn’t heard
                that expression since his father passed away. “Never start what
                you can’t finish,” his father would always say before he would
                hold him across his knees to pass out what he referred to as
                Patriarchal Justice. Meanwhile his mother would hide in the
                kitchen baking and pretending that she couldn’t hear the cries
                coming from the living room.</p>
            <p>The memories of his childhood had sent shivers down Detective
                Wentworth’s spine and his timing could not have been worse.
                Nobody had entered the Brown Note through a back door and walked
                unnoticed up to Detective Wentworth just he was reminiscing
                about his heinous childhood. The already quite jumpy Nobody got
                even more suspicious as Detective Wentworth’s shivers jogged him
                out of his memories and back to the cold harsh reality.</p>
            <p>“You Mister Wentworth? You don’t look good. And Nobody not
                telling nothing to somebody who look like you look!” Nobody’s
                English might have been broken but his message was clear as
                day.</p>
            <p>“Perhapth a beer would inthtil thome more trutht in me?” he hoped
                Nobody would at least understand the word ‘beer’ in his
                otherwise incomprehensible choice of words.</p>
            <p>“Beer? No. Nobody not drink beer. Beer is for zhenshchiny. How
                you say, woman-people? No, Nobody want two bottles of vodka and
                Nobody sing like Crested Lark, yes?”</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth had kept the cookie cutter shape in the left
                pocket of his overcoat and now he was caressing the cold
                metallic angel between his fingers to remind him of why he had
                agreed to take on the case.</p>
            <p>The Josephine look-alike made her untimely return with his second
                beer just as he was about to agree to Nobody’s terms.</p>
            <p>“What’th thith? I didn’t order a beer! I only drink thcotthh! Two
                bottleth of vodka and a glath of your thheapetht thcotthh. And
                make it quick thweetheart!” he quickly said before she had any
                time to reply.</p>
            <p>Noticeable upset—she was nobody’s sweetheart but her mom’s—she
                slammed the beer on his table anyway as she turned around and
                started swaying back and forth back to the bar. Pointing towards
                Detective Wentworth she yelled toward Joey, “Two b’ttles of
                Russian water and a glass o’ Horsepiss,” and stormed out through
                the same back door that Nobody had sneaked in through.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth knew he was going to have to apologize to her
                later if he wanted to get a good nights sleep, “Maybe thhe will
                thettle for an ethplanation and a heartfelt thorry?”</p>
            <p>He turned his attention back to Nobody—who by now had calmed down
                enough to take a seat—and tried his best to look serious as he
                handed Nobody a worn photograph of a man in his mid-fifties
                wearing a pinstripe suit.</p>
            <p>“Tell me everything you know about thenator McWilliamth and hith
                dithappearanthe. Why would thomeone want him gone?”</p>

            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">The first two bullets missed</span>
                Detective Wentworth by only a couple of inches.</p>
            <p>“Thon of a bithh!” he yelled out as he threw himself behind a
                large dumpster. Another bullet flew by, taking with it a fist
                sized piece of brick wall as it ricochet into a nearby pile of
                newspapers.</p>

        </div>

            <p class="first-paragraph">“Where’th my gun! Where’th my gun?”
                palming his coat pockets trying to find his Smith &amp; Wesson
                .38—a panicked thought entered his mind—”Thhit, I forgot it in
                the office! I took the thtupid cookie cutterth with me but I
                forgot my revolver.”</p>
            <p>Just as Detective Wentworth was about to surrender to the idea
                that he had forgotten his revolver he could feel the hammer of
                the .38.</p>
            <p>The sense of relief washed over him, like a cold ice cream on a
                hot summer day, as he found his Smith &amp; Wesson .38 in his
                inner left pocket. “Tho, today might not be the day I die after
                all,” he thought to himself as he pulled out the .38 and swung
                open the cylinder.</p>
            <p>“Four. Only four bulletth left. Gotta make ‘em count,” he tried
                to focus his train of thought before taking aim towards the
                mysterious shadow in the alley, who only a few seconds earlier
                had tried to make his brain a permanent part of the wall behind
                him. Squeezing the trigger he shoots and misses.</p>
            <p>“Three.”</p>
            <p>“What if there’th more than one gunman?” the thought hadn’t
                crossed his mind until now. If there were two of them, he was
                done for. Detective Wentworth wasn’t the sharpest shooter by any
                standards but he might still get a lucky shot. But he would
                never get lucky twice.</p>
            <p>“Two.”</p>
            <p>“Thith ith it. The one time I forget to take thothe ecthtra
                clipth with me is the thame day I get thhot at.”</p>
            <p>The rain had subsided a few minutes earlier and as luck would
                have it, the sun finally began to peak out behind the dense veil
                of clouds, letting out a few streaks of light that made their
                way past him and reflected of the glasses worn by the mysterious
                shadow in the alley. He would never get a better shot than this
                and didn’t waste the opportunity.</p>
            <p>“One.”</p>
            <p>His final shot did as all the other shots before it, and
                missed.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Click, click.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>He threw the .38 to his side as another set of bullets flew
                through the air like angry wasps, causing a lone pigeon to
                awaken from its midday slumber and fly away in panic.</p>
            <p>There he was, a slightly overweight Private Detective named Dick
                Wentworth, on what was looking to become his last job. The
                clouds had dispersed completely now and as he sat crouched
                underneath a turquoise sky, behind a dumpster—filled with
                spoiled crayfish and other crustaceans—he couldn’t help but
                think about some of the choices he had made throughout his
                life.</p>
            <p>A loud twang echoed through the alley as another few rounds
                ricochets off the dumpster.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Stealing a kiss from Sarah Robinson back when he was in fourth
                grade, “Worth it.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Finding his fathers hidden stash of alcohol and consuming it all
                whilst he was home alone, only to vomit it up 15 minutes later,
                “Worth it.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Tricking that poor retarded boy in his boarding school to eat dog
                shit by convincing him it was pudding, “Worth it.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Forgetting to take the extra clips for his .38 when he left the
                office three weeks ago, “Tho thtupid.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Click, click.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>An all too familiar sound, expect it wasn’t Detective Wentworth’s
                revolver that had made the sound this time.</p>
            <p>In the blink of an eye Detective Wentworth jumped out from his
                protective dumpster and rushed towards the mysterious
                shadow.</p>
            <p>Caught off guard by Detective Wentworth’s energized sprint the
                shadow blurted, “Scheisse!” before quickly turning around to run
                away. But the still wet ground made it difficult to get traction
                and Detective Wentworth caught up with him halfway through the
                alley tackling him to the ground.</p>
            <p>“Verdammtes Schwein!” the mysterious stranger exclaimed as he hit
                the ground.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth regained his composure faster than the
                stranger and as he stood up he did his best to seem threatening
                and imposing, which was helped by the massive amounts of
                adrenaline pumping through his veins.</p>
            <p>“Who thent you? Who wantth me dead? Give me a name and give it
                fatht!” he was practically screaming at the stranger who had
                only just regained his balance and was beginning to stand
                up.</p>
            <p>“Du kannst mich mal am Arsch lecken, Mistkerl! I werde dir nie
                was sagen—”</p>
            <p>The stranger—making no intentions to stop his cursing—was
                slightly taller than Detective Wentworth but before either of
                them had the chance to notice it Detective Wentworth punched him
                in the left eye causing him to go down on one knee.</p>
            <p>“Don’t make me have to repeat mythelf! I don’t like repeating
                mythelf!”</p>
            <p>The adrenaline was still pumping, although at a substantially
                lower level, and he could feel his aggressive demeanor heading
                towards a humiliating halt if he didn’t get some useful
                information out of this stranger soon. Left with very few
                options and vivid flashbacks of his own experiences with school
                yard bullies he did the first thing that came to mind, and
                kicked the stranger in the groin.</p>
            <p>The crunching sound echoed through the alley and the German’s
                cursing turned into a wheezy couching.</p>
            <p>“Na, ja, ja! Ich spreche doch,” he put his left hand up to
                suggest defeat—cupping his testicles with his right hand— and
                tried to stand up again.</p>
            <p>“Aber du sollst mich auch nicht wieder treten, du amerikanischer
                Schweinehund,” he muttered under his breath as he finally stood
                up.</p>
            <p>“My name is Viktor Kuhnert. Ich wurde nicht hierher geschickt um
                dich zu töten, man wollte nur dass ich dich verschrecken sollte.
                I have not been sent to kill you, only to scare you away. But
                seeing as we are both out of bullets, I think it will be better
                if you come meet meinen Arbeitgeber. Maybe you are a man mit dem
                man vernünftig reden kann? A man of reason? Here, take my
                pistol, as you can see ich habe keine Kugeln mehr. No
                bullets.”</p>
            <p>As Viktor Kuhnert leaned forward and handed over his Borchardt
                C-93 pistol, Detective Wentworth saw a Großkreuz tattoo on his
                left collarbone.</p>
            <p>“Shall we go? Mein Auto steht on the other side of this
                building,” Viktor tried his best to seem sincere as he gave way
                for Detective Wentworth.</p>

            <h2>Leering Pale Green Eyes</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">Peering through the ominous night sky,</span>
                the moon is shining down on an undisclosed industrial area. The
                only sounds heard in the background are the crickets with their
                lonely tune and some faint indistinct Baroque music playing on a
                gramophone.</p>

<div class="viewport">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p class="first-paragraph">Detective Wentworth is sitting on rickety
                wooden chair trying his best not to vomit into the burlap sack
                he’s wearing on his head. The car journey here, he could have
                handled but being blindfolded with an old burlap sack smelling
                of figs was more than he could handle. As he forces the nausea
                back down his throat he can hear a door opening in the distance
                and synchronized footsteps approaching. But before he has time
                to speak up, a hand grabs on to the burlap sack and pulls it off
                his head.</p>
            <p>It doesn’t take long for his eyes to adjust as the only two
                sources of light comes from the moon peering in through the
                barred up windows and the thin cigarette held between the teeth
                of the shortest of the five men standing in front of him.</p>
            <p>“I apologize for ze unsanitary sack you were forced to wear Herr
                Wentworth but we were not expecting visitors on such a short
                notice and I am afraid we are in no position to take risks right
                now. But I do not wish to seem impolite, can I get you
                something? You look a little thirsty, some water perhaps?” the
                short man signals to one of the soldiers as he puffs to inhale
                another breath from his cigarette.</p>
            <p>“Jawohl, Herr Oberstleutnant König!” springing to attention the
                soldier steps forward.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Colonel Walter König’s tone of voice turns harsher as
                he addresses the soldier, “Bringen Sie uns Wasser und zwei
                Gläser. Wir wollen doch nicht dass Herr Wentworth uns für
                Barbaren hält.”</p>
            <p>Eager to impress his commanding officer the soldier is only gone
                for a few minutes before returning with a canteen of water and
                two glasses.</p>
            <p>“We need you to not find Senator Robert McWilliams. And as mein
                Mitarbeiter Herr Kuhnert already tried and failed to ‘persuade’
                you using ze violence, I would like to appeal to your
                intelligence.”</p>
            <p>As Detective Wentworth looked at Viktor Kuhnert, who was standing
                a bit further back, he could now see the similarities between
                Viktor and himself. A slightly overweight man in in his
                mid-forties, dark brown hair, leering pale green eyes framed by
                thin glasses. Whilst Detective Wentworth had no need for
                glasses, they both had forgettable faces.</p>
            <p>“I’m afraid time is no longer on our side so I am going to get to
                ze point. There is an ambitious and dangerous man in Deutsches
                Reich who is trying to start a revolution. Ze men I work for,
                and their Triumvirate, has already stopped him once but ze volk
                has begun sympathizing with this common Gefreiter and his
                crusade for Lebensraum. Senator McWilliams ‘shares’ our
                nationalistic views and he is vital in our plans to permanently
                remove this Gefreiter.”</p>
            <p>“So, Herr Wentworth, what will it take to get you to stay out of
                our plans? Money? Women? Men?”</p>
            <p>For once in his life Detective Wentworth had managed to stay
                focused on the talkative man in front of him, and had heard
                every word of the surprisingly good English he had spoken.</p>
            <p>“Let me get thith thtraight, you’ll give me whatever I want and
                in exthhange I’ll jutht forget I ever heard of a man named
                Thenator Robert McWilliamth?” he made his best effort to conceal
                the excitement over this prospective deal.</p>
            <p>He was quite tired of trying to find this elusive Senator anyway
                and given enough money he could retire, again. And stay
                retired.</p>
            <p>Whilst Detective Wentworth took careful sips from his water
                glass—fighting the lingering nausea from the fig smelling bag—he
                daydreamed about all the things he could buy with this imaginary
                money of his.</p>
            <p>He had been eyeing the new Chevrolet Superior Series B that had
                come out earlier that year, “I could even get two of them and
                never have to look at my banged up Tin Litthie again”.</p>
            <p>And, instead of getting the cheapest scotch his local bootlegger
                usually had, he would get the third most expensive one.</p>
            <p>As Detective Wentworth had gotten older his imagination had
                shriveled—however small it had been to begin with—even his
                wildest dreams were now small and ordinary.</p>
            <p>“I want 200,000 in American Dollarth—” interrupting himself he
                then continued, “and I want to meet Marion Harrith”.</p>
            <p>Lt. Colonel König pulled up a chair in front of Detective
                Wentworth and lit himself another cigarette, offering one to
                Detective Wentworth as well.</p>
            <p>“Yeth, thank you. What brand ith thith?” having said his price
                out loud has given him enough confidence to try some small
                talk.</p>
            <p>“Früher Tod, a very common German brand.”</p>
            <p>“Now, Herr Wentworth, I do not know who this Frau Harris is but I
                am sure we can arrange for you two to meet… and ze money, will
                not be a problem at all. In fact, as a sign of good faith we
                will give you half now. So, we have an arrangement, ja? You will
                give us all ze information of Senator McWilliams and then this
                meeting never happened.”</p>
            <p>Lt. Colonel König signals to the eager soldier again and
                continues, “Rufen Sie Staatskommissar von Kahr an und sagen Sie
                ihm, er soll eine Geldüberweisung ausstellen, der Amerikanser
                ist bereit mit uns zusammen zu arbeiten.”</p>
            <p>“Do you have all ze information with you?” Lt. Colonel König says
                as he turns around to face Detective Wentworth.</p>
            <p>“Most of them yeth, and a few fileth at my office. But I can burn
                thothe,” realizing the ludicrousness of his proposal, he is
                about to continue when Lt. Colonel König puts up his hand in a
                stopping motion.</p>
            <p>“I am afraid that will not do Herr Wentworth, I must see that we
                get everything. We do not want to risk leaving anything loose.
                Me and meine Mitarbeiter will take you to your office to get ze
                files, you will get ze first half of ze money and we will leave.
                We will call you to arrange ze rest of the arrangement, ja?”</p>
            <p>“Okay.”</p>
            <p>“Now, I’m afraid we are going to have to put ze sack on your head
                again.”</p>
            <p>Nodding in compliance, Detective Wentworth finished his cigarette
                and took a deep breath just as the sack was put back on his
                head. The pungent smell of figs made him nauseous again.</p>
            <p>“Find your happy plathe, find your happy plathe…” he repeated to
                himself as he fought the urge to vomit again.</p>

            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">Once Lt. Colonel König and</span>
                his conscripts had collected all the files they wanted and left,
                Detective Wentworth found himself alone in his office again, but
                this time with a bearer bond for $100,000 lying on his desk and
                a bright future ahead of him.</p>

            <p class="first-paragraph">First he contemplated taking the next
                flight to South America but after realizing he didn’t speak the
                language—come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure what language
                they spoke—he decided it was in everyone’s best interest—not to
                mention, his own—to avoid South America for the time being.</p>
            <p>Left with few options and as shriveling as his imagination was,
                he decided to simply go across the corner to his favorite
                watering hole, the Wench &amp; Hare Inn where he knew most of
                the local patrons and his cheap no-particular-brand of scotch
                was usually available. The Inn rarely had any violent crimes so
                the police left them to mind their own business and would most
                of the time ignore their violations against the Prohibition
                Act.</p>
            <p>It had started snowing—the first of the winter—on this crisp
                December morning and with the temperature hovering around 29 °F,
                this winter was colder than last years. Detective Wentworth
                hurried across the road to get into the warmth again.</p>
            <p>Stepping into the Wench &amp; Hare Inn, Detective Wentworth could
                hear a song he had heard many times this year but could never
                name, the lyrics “Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days”
                echoing through the half empty Inn and taunting his bad
                memory.</p>
            <p>“Robby, can I get a glathth of your more finer thcotch? None of
                that cheap thtuff for me tonight. And two packetth of Deep
                Throat,” he looked around to see who was in this morning.</p>
            <p>“Well, if it isn’t another familiar face. Looks like someone’s
                closed another case, ey? Are you sure about the scotch though,
                you remember what happened last time? I really can’t afford to
                upholster the chairs again, Dick,” Robby gave him that same look
                that his mother use to give him when he had done something
                stupid with disastrous results.</p>
            <p>“I think you’ll find that a lot hath changed thince—”</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth suddenly realized that he hadn’t been at the
                Wench &amp; Hare Inn since earlier that April.</p>
            <p>“—You do know that I haven’t been here thince Arbor Day, right? I
                think you’ll find that I’ve gotten a lot more tolerant thince
                then,” he opened one of the packets of Deep Throat and lit
                himself a cigarette.</p>
            <p>“Sure, sure, if you say so. But any repairs are coming out of
                your pocket this time. And well, the only fancy stuff I’ve got
                right now is half a bottle of Dickel No. 12. It’s nicely aged
                though, distilled before they moved their operation to
                Kentucky,” Robby explained. Of the three things in life he knew
                well, alcohol was one of them.</p>
            <p>“I’ll take the whole bottle. Keep the change jutht in cathe I
                vomit on anything,” said Detective Wentworth as he placed one of
                the $50 bills on the counter and went to sit down.</p>
            <p>It didn’t take long before he was lost in daydreaming about all
                the things he would buy for his newly acquired riches. Fantasies
                about driving Chevrolet Superior Series B began to grow in his
                mind but before he could rev the engine his thoughts were
                interrupted by the voice of a woman standing behind him.</p>
            <p>“Mind if I join you?” her soft voice was a gentle whisper.</p>
            <p>“Of courthe not, have a theat. Are you a thcotch drinker?” he
                couldn’t do much about the lisp but at least the scotch had done
                wonders for the stutter he would sometimes get when he got
                nervous.</p>
            <p>A couple of hours later Detective Wentworth found himself back in
                his run-down office-turned-apartment. But unlike most other
                occasions he wasn’t alone this time.</p>
            <p>“Why don’t you put on some music whilst I pour up the last of
                this fine scotch?” her name was Grace and she didn’t seem to
                mind the state of decay that surrounded them.</p>
            <p>He drank it all in one sweep—partly to impress her—and partly
                because to his delight he had discovered that he could handle
                this scotch better than others.</p>
            <p>“It must be such an exciting job to be a private investigator.
                Tell me, have you ever been shot?” she made no efforts to hide
                her excitement over the possibility that he had stories of
                bullets and blood.</p>
            <p>“Of courthe I have. It goeth with the job—”</p>
            <p>From the corner of his eye Detective Wentworth could—as clear as
                day—see a shiny white bunny, sitting and eating a piece of
                carrot. The white bunny was wearing a bright purple tie and a
                monocle. And as Detective Wentworth focused and tried to
                decipher whether or not what he saw was real, the bunny looked
                straight at him and spoke with a gravely voice.</p>
            <p>“Hey, buddy! Makes you wish you hadn’t downed it all at once,
                right?”</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth staggered into a nearby chair, “You drugged
                me?”</p>
            <p>“Poisoned actually. Enough to kill two men of your size, I didn’t
                want to take my chances in case you would be more resilient. My
                informant said you wouldn’t be much of a challenge and despite
                my doubts it would appear he was correct. A pity really, I was
                almost looking forward to seducing you first but I suppose this
                will have to do,” the excited glow in her face had turned into a
                vacant stare.</p>
            <p>He should have known better than to think any woman would be
                interested in a slightly overweight smoker in his
                mid-forties.</p>
            <p>“The Thparrow Brotherth thnt you, didn’t they?” he tried to keep
                calm but his heart was racing and the bunny was distracting him.
                Having finished its carrot, it was now preparing to use its own
                tie as a noose.</p>
            <p>“Here, but for the Grace of God. No, the Sparrow Brothers didn’t
                send me. I don’t know who they are,” she said as she was looking
                through his wallet trying to find some identification.</p>
            <p>“Richard William Wentworth. Your mother didn’t have much of an
                imagination, did she?”</p>
            <p>“If the Thparrow Brotherth didn’t thend you, then who and
                why?”</p>
            <p>“Look, some people really don’t want to be found. My employer
                just so happens to be one of those people. Don’t take it
                personally, I’m just doing my job. It was either this or
                prostitution,” her voice had turned more sympathetic as she was
                searching his desk drawers for any valuables she could pawn.</p>
            <p>“Do you really have nothing but yellow faded newspapers and that
                dying plant over the—”</p>
            <p>“Fig.”</p>
            <p>“Excuse me?”</p>
            <p>“It’th a weeping fig. A Ficuth benjamina. They were my motherth
                favorite. Maybe you could give it thome water, I’ve been
                neglecting it for thome time,” his voice was getting weaker.</p>
            <p>As Detective Wentworth’s eyes grew heavier and heavier he could
                feel his own consciousness slipping away only to rush back as he
                tried his best to hold onto reality. He tried to steel his mind
                on the oil lamp burning behind her but it was already too late,
                his eyes couldn’t focus any more. His heartbeat was beating
                slower and his mouth was getting dry and cotton-like.</p>
            <p>“You guys always have a hidden safe somewhere? Where is it?” she
                asked and turned around when she didn’t get a reply.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth’s eyes were now closed.</p>

            <p>Richard Wentworth stood there for a moment, wishing he could run
                up to his mother to hug her and tell her that everything would
                be all right, but he couldn’t. No matter how vivid and tangible
                all of this felt, it was still a memory and nothing more.</p>
            <p>Losing its grip on reality his mind was finding safety in the few
                ‘good’ memories he had. And in this memory of his, he hadn’t
                hugged her. Instead he had quickly turned around to run towards
                to the entrance of the World Fair. In hindsight he wished he had
                hugged his mother instead.</p>
            <p>“That’ll be 25¢, little man,” said the man in the ticket
                booth.</p>
            <p>“I’m actually over fourteen,” replied Richard who was short for
                his age and was often mistaken for being younger than he really
                was.</p>
            <p>“Well then, little man, who’s actually over fourteen, you get to
                pay 50¢ like an adult,” the ticket man appeared amused by his
                insistence on paying full price.</p>
            <p>Richard stared in awe at the ticket in his hand. World’s
                Colombian Exposition it proclaimed proudly and he tried to
                ignore the thoughts of what his father would do if he ever found
                out that he had attended the World Fair. </p>
            <p>It wasn’t until he reached a sight he had never seen before that
                he snapped out his trance-like state. Standing in front of him
                was the 250 feel tall steel construction of the Ferris’ Wheel.
                The first of its kind. Looking back towards the entrance he
                could see how the queue slithered all the way up to the man in
                the ticket booth. He knew he couldn’t be at the fair all day—his
                father would get suspicious—so he wouldn’t have time to queue
                for the Ferris’ Wheel but he could at least enjoy the terrifying
                shadow its steely skeleton cast on the ground.</p>
            <p>He continued walking, stopping only to watch an exhibition called
                Street in Cairo with women dancing and shaking their bellies in
                a way he had never seen before. Plenty of men and women were
                standing at this exhibition mesmerized by the exotic dancers but
                Richard had something else in mind. According to George ‘Doily’
                Porter, a German company called Krupp were displaying, “the
                biggest guns you had ever seen,” somewhere at the fair and
                Richard was determined to verify Doily’s—often greatly
                exaggerated—claims with his own eyes.</p>
            <p>But as he continued exploring the fair he started losing his
                sense of direction in the crowds of people and soon found
                himself in middle of an even larger gathering of people. As he
                tried to orient himself in the crowd he could hear a powerful
                voice rise above the tallest of heads.</p>
            <p>“Come on folks, don’t be shy. Come closer an’ let good ol’ Aunt
                Jemima shows you how you too can make dem dee-licious golden
                pancakes,” said the woman wearing a bandana headband and an
                apron.</p>
            <p>Richard could only see glimpses of her between the shoulders in
                front of him.</p>
            <p>“Only wif my magic recipe can you turn out dem appetitin',
                taste-delightin' jiffy-quick pancakes that makes ‘yo family
                happy. An’ you knows what they say; You doubled ‘yo own
                happiness when ‘yo shared it with dem other folks,” she kept
                talking whilst stirring the batter, not missing the beat for a
                second, drawing the crowd ever closer and Richard couldn’t help
                but get drawn in with everyone else.</p>
            <p>“Mm-m-m! My secret recipe is made from wheat, corn an’ rice an’
                I’s can guarantee that you ain’t neve’ tasted pancakes so
                temptilatin’ as these,” she said as she poured up perfectly
                sized cakes of batter on the griddle.</p>
            <p>The sweet aroma of pancakes blew through the crowd, turning an
                already hungry crowd into a starving one. Everyone was eager to
                taste Aunt Jemima’s pancakes and the people further back began
                to push themselves forward in an attempt to better their odds of
                tasting the first batch.</p>
            <p>Special police officers had been assigned to keep the crowds
                moving but were finding it difficult to remain assertive in the
                escalating chaos. Richard—figuring he would never get a pancake
                anyway—took the chance to escape as he saw a small opening to
                his right.</p>
            <p>A few hours later Richard found himself in front of the world’s
                largest flour barrel again, the lingering scent of pancakes
                still in the air, but no Aunt Jemima in sight. The previously
                enormous crowd of a few hundred people had thinned out to a few
                dozen and most of them seemed to be well fed at this point.</p>
            <p>Sitting down on a nearby bench, Richard had to face the facts:
                Clearly he had no idea how to find the Germans and their big
                guns and it was getting late. As long as he made it home before
                3pm his father wouldn’t see any reason to be suspicious but any
                later than that and Richard would have to answer questions he
                didn’t have answers to.</p>
            <p>Somewhere along the way—following the directions of a young
                couple —he had stumbled into the building for Agriculture where
                he had found an elven-ton block of cheese from Canada and a
                miniature model of a Western farm but no guns.</p>
            <p>“Why honey child, ain’t you the most saddest boy I’s seen today?”
                Aunt Jemima exclaimed as she came walking out from behind the
                flour barrel shaped building.</p>
            <p>“Yeah, I wath looking for thomething that I couldn’t find,”
                Richard said with the sound of defeat only a child could. Aunt
                Jemima sat down beside him and gave him a piece of the pancake
                she was eating.</p>
            <p>“Well, sometimes dem things we be looking fo’, arent’ dem things
                we be meant to find,” she said and finished her half of the
                pancake.</p>
            <p>Standing back up again, she walked back towards her flour barrel
                but before closing the door she turned around to leave Richard
                with another one of her sayings, “You’s know what they say; Dem
                happy folks don’t measure time by years, but by dem smiles they
                be spreadin’ in the world.”</p>

                on Drury Lane, taking the adulterous city of Chicago and its
                indiscretions and covering them in a white blanket of
                forgiveness. The wind is howling through an open window and
                sirens wail in the distance. Detective Wentworth is slumped in a
                chair in his office, his eyes are closed and the cigarette is
                his hand has almost burned to its end.</p>

            <p class="first-paragraph">Grace is standing next to Detective
                Wentworth. An attractive freckle-faced woman in her late
                twenties with bright copper colored hair and olive green eyes
                and with the exception of her two children very few people
                called her by her real name anymore. “Catherine couldn’t take
                care of us, but Grace can,” she would remind herself
                occasionally. </p>
            <p>“Bastard.”</p>
            <p>“The poison wasn’t supposed to act that quickly,” she muttered to
                herself whilst throwing Detective Wentworth’s things around.</p>
            <p>Holding him by his trench coat she was shaking him violently,
                “Can you still hear me? Where do you keep the safe?”</p>
            <p>His head fell backward as she let go and there was no answer.
                Pressing her ear to his chest she could still hear his shallow
                breathing underneath the sound of the skipping record.</p>
            <p>“Where have you gone?” she stood up looking at him for a while
                before turning her attention to the skipping record.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">…</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>“Sometimes your father just won’t take ‘No’ for an answer, you
                know that. We’ll say you earned them doing chores for Mrs.
                Wilson,” having turned around before she had finished her
                sentence she was already walking away.</p>
            <p>Richard Wentworth stood there for a moment, wishing he could run
                up to his mother to hug her and tell her that everything would
                be all right.</p>
            <p>Every time his mind replayed this moment he would always turn
                around and run toward the fair, but this time something was
                different. This time, as if his legs could hear his inner voice,
                he ran and caught up with his mother, embracing her with his
                scrawny arms.</p>
            <p>“I’m sorry mom, I’m sorry I couldn’t get you away from him in
                time,” he was struggling to keep the tears away.</p>
            <p>Hugging him back she did what any mother would and comforted him,
                “That’s all right honey, it’s not your fault—”</p>
            <p>“But it is,” Richard howled, “If only I had—”</p>
            <p>“Pish posh, I chose to stay. To protect you. To keep you safe.
                That’s what moms are for you know, to protect their little ones.
                You did all you ever could have,” his mother stroked the hair on
                his neck as she calmed him down.</p>
            <p>Putting her hands on his shoulders she looked him straight in the
                eyes, “Now, you put those foolish thoughts of yours to rest and
                go and enjoy yourself, okay? And don’t you worry about me, it’s
                supposed to be the other way ‘round.”</p>
            <p>Richard wiped away the snot on his sleeve and looked back at his
                mother, “Okay, I will.”</p>
            <p>“That’s my boy,” kissing Richard on his forehead she stood up,
                “I’ll see you later,” his mother said before vanishing into thin
                air.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align:center">…</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Returning from the kitchen—having gone through his
                cupboards—Grace grabbed Detective Wentworth by the neck of his
                trench coat again, shaking him backward and forward she tried to
                wake him up but it was already too late.</p>
            <p>Richard William Wentworth, ‘Dick’ to his acquaintances and the
                few people he had called ‘friends’, had taken his final breath a
                few minutes earlier. Grace let go when she noticed herself
                staring into the slightly open mouth of a dead man whose body
                was still very warm but other than that had no signs of
                life.</p>
            <p>Frustrated at herself for giving Richard too much poison she sat
                down in the chair by his desk. The armrests were worn out at the
                edges and the cushion felt like it had no stuffing any more.</p>
            <p>“Richard, Richard, where have you hidden these riches of yours?”
                she said to herself.</p>
            <p>There was nothing of any value as far as she could see and most
                of the junk here looked like the kind you would have to pay
                someone just to get rid of.</p>
            <p>“You didn’t get a lot of visitors here, did you? With the state
                this place is in, I’m surprised you even invited me back here,”
                leaning back in the chair she accidentally bumped into a few
                carefully balanced boxes that proceeded to fall, taking several
                piles of newspapers with them.</p>
            <p>Letting out a loud sigh she crouched down to clean up the
                mess.</p>
            <p>“Wherever I go, there’s always a mess I have to clean up. When is
                it going to be my turn to sit back and watch as someone else
                cleans up my mess?”</p>
            <p>She looked toward Richard and his flaccid body, slumped down in
                the rickety chair, “Though I suppose you won’t mind if I tidy
                this place up a bit, eh?”</p>
            <p>Her gaze shifted focus to the bookcase behind Richard and from
                her crouched down position she would clearly discern what looked
                like a piece of paper, nestled between ‘This Side of Paradise’
                by F. Scott Fitzgerald and a coverless Hemingway’s ‘A Farewell
                to Arms’.</p>
            <p>Richard William Wentworth hadn’t been much of a reader, unless it
                was horse racing results, but he had enjoyed the look of rows of
                books and the many adventures he imagined where held between
                their covers.</p>
            <p>Dropping the newspapers from her hands she walked over to the
                bookcase to discover that what she had mistaken for a piece of
                paper was actually an envelope. Thumbed and worn on the edges
                the envelope had the name ‘Richard’ written in beautiful female
                penmanship on its front.</p>
            <p>“Did you have someone special after all?” Grace thought to
                herself, she only spoke a few words of French—most of which were
                swearwords—but she could recognize a love-letter when she saw
                one.</p>
            <p>Whoever this Josephine is or was, she had clearly felt strongly
                about Richard and by the look of the envelope and letter, so had
                he.</p>
            <p>Aside for the letter inside, Grace also found the bearer bond for
                $100,000.</p>
            <p>Grace hadn’t been sure if Richard had been telling the truth when
                he had bragged about his newly acquired riches. She had told him
                that he wasn’t the first one to try to get her with a line like
                that.</p>
            <p>Now she stood there silently for—what felt like hours—but was
                minutes, before finally falling to her knees. Under her breath,
                as if she still needed to hide it from the world, the tears came
                streaming down but she was smiling a smile she hadn’t done in
                years.</p>
            <p>“We don’t need you any more, Grace.”</p>

            <h2>Black And Blue</h2>
            <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="first-line">Of all the detectives</span>
                east of Missouri, Detective Wentworth had to be the one they had
                called. The Sparrow Brother’s circus, like all of them, boldly
                claimed to be the “Most Expectacular Show on Earth” but
                Detective Wentworth knew better.</p>

<div class="viewport splash-island">
    <div class="container">

            <p class="first-paragraph">More like, “Motht Ethpenthive Thhow on
                Earth,” he thought.</p>
            <p>The early morning air was heavy with the wet smell of hay as the
                first rays of the sun had yet to warm up the ground. A few
                locals had gotten up early to watch the circus crew set up their
                tents in preparation for the evening’s show.</p>
            <p>The lions were sleeping and took no notice of Detective Wentworth
                walking by, unlike the elephant, who seemed eager to make his
                acquaintance but couldn’t get close enough because of its
                chained foot.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth had been told to look for a red wagon in the
                “back yard” and had been assured that it would be easy to spot
                once he reached far enough.</p>
            <p>“I told you already; I don’t care how bad her knee it, as long as
                ‘Babyfeet’ is gone Élise needs to stand in her place,” Samuel,
                the younger Sparrow brother, was shouting and waving his arms
                around.</p>
            <p>Making no efforts to hide his temper Samuel turned to Detective
                Wentworth, “And the fuck are you?”</p>
            <p>“I’m the private detective you hired to find your trapethe girl,
                Minnie ‘Babyfeet’ Walker,” Detective Wentworth knocked out a
                cigarette from his crumpled pack of Deep Throat.</p>
            <p>“No, you want my brother Arthur. I didn’t hire anyone,” Samuel
                had started walking away but before he was out of sight
                Detective Wentworth could hear him shout, “Gillys don’t smoke in
                our wagons.”</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth slipped the lip-marked cigarette back into
                its pack.</p>
            <p>“Aah. You must be the detective, Mr. Wortwort?”</p>
            <p>“Wentworth.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, of course, I’m sorry. You’ll have to excuse my poor
                brother’s demeanor. It’s his turn to be in charge this month and
                he ain’t too happy about one of our stars disappearing like
                this. Which is why you’re here. But he ain’t too happy about
                that either, says your kind ‘brings more trouble than you fix’—”
                Arthur Sparrow seemed more mature despite being three younger
                than his brother, Samuel.</p>
            <p>Offering Detective Wentworth a cigarette and taking one for
                himself Arthur continued, “—But regardless of his disposition we
                need outside help. Our Ms. Walker has been missing for a week
                and rumors are starting to spread that she has joined another
                circus.”</p>
            <p>“But you don’t think tho?” Detective Wentworth lit the gifted
                cigarette and thought, “Tasteth like wet horthe. Jutht my
                luck.”</p>
            <p>“Well no. Her ‘father’ Eddie passed away a few years back and
                even though she has been growing more distant since then, this
                has always been her home,” Arthur looked tired, like someone who
                hadn’t had a good nights sleep for months.</p>
            <p>“What about her mother? Ith thhe not around?” Detective Wentworth
                was taking notes on a newspaper he had picked up earlier.</p>
            <p>“No, she doesn’t have one. One of our roustabouts found her as a
                baby behind a bale of hay and ever since that day, Edward
                ‘Eddie’ Walker—may he rest in peace—took her in and became her
                father. You would be surprised how many times people leave
                babies at circuses,” Arthur didn’t seem to mind the wet horse
                taste of his cigarettes.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth continued to take notes; Father: Deceased.
                Mother: Unknown. No next of kin. “Doeth thhe have a boyfriend?”
                he then asked.</p>
            <p>“No. There was this fling she had with one of the
                clowns—Thomas—recently, but that was quite short-lived. I’ve, of
                course, already had a word with him: Says he’s fine and that
                life goes on.”</p>
            <p>“And you believe him?”</p>
            <p>“Undoubtedly. He’s always been more like a brother to her anyway,
                stepping in and defending her when audience members would get
                too friendly.”</p>
            <p>“Are there any other people I thhould talk to?” Detective
                Wentworth asked before putting out the cigarette and getting up
                to leave the wagon.</p>
            <p>By the time he had talked to and crossing out all but one name
                from the scrabbled down list in his newspaper-turned-notebook,
                the sun had already set and it was getting dark. After much
                searching Detective Wentworth had finally found Thomas behind
                the lion cage as he was getting ready for tonight’s show.</p>
            <p>Thomas, who had made no efforts to hide his distaste for
                Detective Wentworth’s presence had also appeared eager to get
                rid of him by excusing himself with needing to get ready for the
                show of the night, “I’m sorry Mr. Wentworth but Samuel doesn’t
                like it when we’re late,” he had said before leaving.</p>
            <p>“Whatever the clown ith hiding he’th doing it well. I thuppothe
                thpending motht of your life behind a mathk will do that to
                you,” Detective Wentworth thought to himself as he underlined
                Thomas’ name on his makeshift list.</p>
            <p>Standing there he could hear thunder in the distance and with the
                southbound winds tonight it wouldn’t take long for “God’s
                Wrath”—as his father would call it—to rain down on the departing
                visitors of the Sparrow Brothers and their “Most Expectacular
                Show on Earth” circus.</p>
            <p>“What ith he hiding? Doeth he know where thith Minnie girl ith?
                He thtriketh me ath a man hiding a debt more than kidnapping a
                young woman, but then again, what do I know?” Detective
                Wentworth thought to himself as he tried to light a cigarette in
                the increasing wind, “I’ll thhadow you after the thhow, thooner
                or later you’ll make a mithtake. Everyone maketh
                mithtaketh.”</p>
            <p>And just like Detective Wentworth had anticipated, a few hours
                later the rain was already pouring down fast and hard and the
                looming thunderstorms painted the night sky in shades of black
                and grey. He had patiently waited for the evening’s show to end
                and for Thomas—the punctual clown—to let down his guard.</p>
            <p>After the show Thomas and few circus workers had hitched a ride
                into nearby ‘Mound City’ where they had proceeded to drink and
                hustle the locals.</p>
            <p>“Everyone maketh mithtakes,” Detective Wentworth reminded himself
                as the pouring rain was filling his shoes with the mud from the
                alley in which he was standing.</p>
            <p>But just as Detective Wentworth was about to give up, conceding
                to being the one who had made the mistake, he saw Thomas coming
                out from the Butler’s Arm, alone.</p>
            <p>Shadowing him proved to be easier than Detective Wentworth had
                expected as Thomas in his tipsy state of mind didn’t suspect
                that he was being followed as he made his way straight to a
                shadier part of ‘Mound City’.</p>
            <p>The dim candle light couldn’t conceal how worn down the apartment
                she was hiding in was. The wallpapers were peeling themselves of
                the walls, as if to try to escape their inevitable fate, and the
                air tasted like mold.</p>
            <p>“Mth. Walker. You’ve been miththed,” standing drenched in the
                alley had given Detective Wentworth plenty of time to think
                about what he would say and he was feeling quite proud of this
                particular line.</p>
            <p>“You don’t understand. I have to—”</p>
            <p>“Thave yourthelf the explanation. I don’t need to underthtand. I
                wath hired to find you and that’th what I did. I’m jutht doing
                my job, that’th all I do,” Detective Wentworth made sure he was
                still armed by running his finger across the cold steel of the
                M1917 Revolver in his right pocket.</p>
            <p>“You Pinkertons are all the same. Messin’ up things you don’t
                understand. Well you’re going to have to go through me first,”
                puffing himself up Thomas tried to look intimidating.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth remained calm whilst pulling out his revolver
                and aiming it at Thomas, “Look, I’m no Pinkerton but that
                doethn’t mean I won’t uthe thith. Let’th jutht thave ourthelveth
                the trouble.”</p>
            <p>“He’ll beat her black and blue. You can’t do this to her, not
                when she’s having a—”</p>
            <p>“Sssh Thomas, he won’t care about that,” interrupting Thomas,
                Minnie instinctively put her hand to her stomach.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth looked at Minnie for a moment before asking
                her with a warmth he hadn’t felt since his days with Josephine,
                “Are… you?”.</p>
            <p>“I am,” Minnie smiled cautiously, stroking her stomach as she
                spoke, “2 months now and I’m afraid that it’s going to start
                showing soon,” her voice turned cold, “But they won’t allow
                it.”</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>For a moment they all stood there and the only sound that could
                be heard was the angry rain beating down on the roof above
                them.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>“Juth go. Get out of the thity. Get ath far away ath poththible,”
                Detective Wentworth spoke with a firm but soft voice.</p>
            <p>Swinging out the cylinder he unloaded the revolver, handed it and
                its bullets to her, “Here, take the revolver. There’th a lot of
                bad people out there, you’ll need thith to keep you thafe.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you, thank you, thank you. I don’t know what to say,”
                Minnie nervously put the revolver in her trunk.</p>
            <p>Thomas, still distrustful and dumbfounded by Detective
                Wentworth’s sudden change of heart, but not wanting to appear
                unhelpful added, “When I get back to the circus I’ll distract
                them to buy you some extra time.”</p>
            <p>“Thank you Thomas, you’ve always been a good friend,” turning to
                Detective Wentworth Minnie continued, “Again, thank you. I
                didn’t even catch your name.”</p>
            <p>“Detective Rithhard William Wentworth at your thervice, Ma’am,”
                he said trying to lighten the mood but his voice wouldn’t
                obey.</p>
            <p>“William,” Minnie paused, picking up her trunk, “I like that. But
                you should consider a different profession before this one gets
                the best of you.”</p>
            <p>A few days later, instead of reporting back to Arthur Sparrow,
                Detective Wentworth took the earliest train he could back to
                Chicago.</p>
            <p>He later read in the newspaper about an incident at a traveling
                circus in Missouri where one of the owners had snapped over a
                disagreement and beaten an employee to death. The newspaper had
                only referred to Thomas as an unnamed clown with no next of kin,
                in what they had penned as a horrible display of human
                brutality.</p>
            <p>Detective Wentworth had exchanged his glass of water for a glass
                of bad scotch, “That’th it. I’m finithhed being a
                detective.”</p>
